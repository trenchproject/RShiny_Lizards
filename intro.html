<h3>Climate Change Impacts</h3>

Climate change poses a substantial threat to organisms and ecosystems that interact with other stressors including changes in land use. Changes including shifts in temperature and precipitation, more extreme events, and alterations of the timing of biological events are predicted to have substantial impacts on organisms and ecosystems around the world. <br>
<br>

Governments around the world are working together to limit global average temperature increases to a magnitude that will reduce impacts on societies and ecosystems to an acceptable level. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientists have been asking: what impacts will a 1.5°C or 2°C climate warming have on organisms and ecosystems? These temperature targets have been chosen because models and observations suggest that higher targets would have dramatic impacts. <br>
<br>

Translating shifts in air temperature into impacts on organisms is an important challenge because multiple environmental (air and ground temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed) and biological factors (size, shape, color, and composition of organisms) combine to determine the body temperatures organisms experience. Organisms can also spatially and temporally alter how they interact with environmental factors by adjusting their locations or timing of activity. <br>
<br>

Much of the research examining climate change impacts has focused on ectothermic organisms because they produce minimal internal heat and thus rely on environmental sources of heat to reach body temperatures suitable for their activity. Radiation from the sun is an important source of heat that can dramatically raise ecotherm body temperatures above air temperatures. Indeed, many ectotherms require shading to avoid thermal stress (Sunday et al., 2014). When shady sites are available, many ectotherms can behaviorally thermoregulate to maintain temperatures that allow optimal performance by moving between sunny and shady sites and by altering their activity times. A valuable approach for understanding how environmental conditions influence organisms is to quantify how well ectotherms can perform functions over a range of body temperatures. This quantification is termed a thermal performance curve (Sinclair et al., 2016).<br>
<br>

This activity focuses on lizards, which have often been used to study climate change impacts because their performance is highly sensitive to temperature and many lizards use thermoregulation to adjust external heat sources. We examine how environmental conditions determine the body temperatures of lizards and whether they experience thermal stress.

<!--How organisms respond to the ongoing climate change is one of the biggest topics in biology today. Some of the visible consequences include change in temperature and precipitation, increase of extreme events, and alterations of the timing of particular events, which are predicted to have a huge impact on ecosystems around the world. <br>
The repercussions on ectotherms can especially be significant because they either comply with the surrounding thermal environment or rely on behavioral thermoregulation for optimal performance and fitness. Temperature directly impacts their basic physiological functions such as locomotion, growth and reproducion. Their ability to perform such functions over different temperatures is often visualized as a thermal performance curve, which is explained in detail below. <br>
For the purposes of this study, we focus on the implications of the temperature change for lizards by looking at their thermal safety margin.-->

<h3>Introducing Operative Temperature</h3>

<!--The temperature a given organism experiences can depart dramatically from air temperatures due to energy exchange with the environment. For instance, heat is gained by absorbing solar and thermal radiation and from metabolic reactions. It is also lost to the environment through the organism's emission of radiation and the evaporation of water. Additionally, heat exchange with air, water and ground via convection and conduction are constantly occurring. <b> Operative temperature </b> takes these factors into consideration and therefore is a more accurate representation of what the organism is actually experiencing compared to the air or ground temperature.<br>-->

We can predict the body temperature of an organism in a particular environment by summing heat exchanges associated with solar and thermal radiation and with the animal’s contact with the air and surfaces. This activity uses a model to estimate heat gains and losses in order to predict body temperatures. These models are referred to as <b>energy budget</b> or <b>biophysical models</b>. When we use such a model (or a biomimic) to predict equilibrium (steady-state) body temperatures for a particular organism in a particular environment we call the prediction an <b>operative temperature</b>.

<h3>Thermal Performance Curve</h3>
<img src="Rplot.png" width = "650px" align = "right">
<p>
The graph on the right is a <b>thermal performance curve (TPC)</b> of a lizard species <i>Pseummodromus hispanicus</i>. TPCs are constructed with body temperature on the x-axis and the rate of a performance that influences survival or reproductive success on the y-axis. The lower and upper limits of the body temperature range over which performance is above zero are called critical thermal minima and maxima, CTmin and CTmax, respectively. The optimal temperature (Topt) is the body temperature at which the organism attains the highest performance. These three metrics (CTmin, Topt, and CTmax) are often reported as a simple way to describe a TPC. <br>
<br>
Most TPCs exhibit a gradual rise with increasing body temperature before dropping sharply if Topt is exceeded. The rapid drop beyond Topt results in species quickly experiencing thermal stress if their body temperatures deviate from their preferred range. Organisms with Topt that are adapted to their environment can thus be threatened by even small increases in environmental temperatures (Tewksbury et al., 2008).

<!--The graph below is a thermal performance curve of a lizard species <em> Pseummodromus hispanicus </em>. A thermal performance curve typically takes temperature on the x-axis and the performance of the organism on the y-axis, which can be based off of survival or reproductive success. The curve is drawn based on the organism's critical thermal maximum, critical thermal minimum and their optimal tempearture. <br>
Critical thermal maximum and minimum are the highest and lowest temperatures that the organism can tolerete, respectively. The optimal temperature is the temperature that the organism attains the highest performance. That is where the rates of physiological processes involved in food digestion, food assimilation, metabolism, and conversion to somatic tissue are typically high. <br>
Lizards can stay the most active when the thermal environment permits them to attain their preferred range of body temperatures. They can experience higher average rates of the processes listed above, and hence fulfill higher growth rates. <br>

Thermal performance curve has a gradual rise with temperature, reaches the optimal temperature before it drops sharply.
In other words, many organisms that are currently living in their optimal environment can be in danger if tempearture keeps increasing.-->

<h3> What is Thermal Safety Margin (TSM)? </h3>

<b>Thermal safety margin (TSM)</b> is a metric that indicates how much more the temperature can increase before the environment turns uninhabitable. TSM is variably defined but here we estimate TSM as the temperature difference between a lizard’s operative temperature and its critical thermal maximum (Huey et al., 2012). A positive TSM means the environmental temperature is within the thermal tolerance of the organism and a negatinvert raster to date TSM implies that the operative temperature surpasses the critical thermal maximum. In this platform, we use TSM to visualize and address the danger some species might face from increased temperature.

<h4>Modelling approach and data sources</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Lizard range maps were obtained from <a href = https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download> IUCN </a>. </li>
  <li>Climate and zenith angle data are long-term (1961-1990) monthly averages for 15km grids from Kearney et al. (2014, microclim: Global estimates of hourly microclimate based on long-term monthly climate averages).  We use air temperature 1 cm above the ground assuming a soil substrate, ground temperature at depths of 0 cm under ground assuming a soil substrate, and wind speed 1cm above ground. Shade level of 0% and 100% correspond to "exposed" and "covered".</li>
